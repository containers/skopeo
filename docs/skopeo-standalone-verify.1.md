% skopeo-standalone-verify(1)

## NAME
skopeo\-standalone\-verify - Verify an image signature.

## SYNOPSIS
**skopeo standalone-verify** _manifest_ _docker-reference_ _key-fingerprint_ _signature_

## DESCRIPTION

Verify a signature using local files, digest will be printed on success. This is primarily a debugging tool, or useful for special cases,
and usually should not be a part of your normal operational workflow.

  _manifest_ Path to a file containing the image manifest

  _docker-reference_ A docker reference expected to identify the image in the signature

  _key-fingerprint_ Expected identity of the signing key

  _signature_ Path to signature file

**Note:** If you do use this, make sure that the image can not be changed at the source location between the times of its verification and use.

## EXAMPLES

```sh
$ skopeo standalone-verify busybox-manifest.json registry.example.com/example/busybox 1D8230F6CDB6A06716E414C1DB72F2188BB46CC8  busybox.signature
Signature verified, digest sha256:20bf21ed457b390829cdbeec8795a7bea1626991fda603e0d01b4e7f60427e55
```

## NOTES

As described in [Container signature format](https://github.com/containers/image/blob/main/docs/containers-signature.5.md), this command is intended for use with local signatures, such as OpenPGP. Further, this command does **not** interact with the artefacts generated by [Docker Content Trust (DCT)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/).
